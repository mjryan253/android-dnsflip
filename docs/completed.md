## ✅ Phase 20: Critical Shizuku Limitation Discovery, Alternative Approaches Required (December 2024)

### Critical Discovery
- **Shizuku Limitation Identified**: Shizuku cannot grant `WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` permission - this is a fundamental system restriction
- **Permission Testing Results**: Even with manual Shizuku access granted, DNS operations still fail with SecurityException
- **Evidence Analysis**: Comprehensive logcat monitoring revealed consistent SecurityException patterns
- **User Testing Confirmed**: Manual permission granting in Shizuku app did not resolve the issue

### Alternative Approach Research
- **ADB Method Investigation**: Research into ADB-based permission granting methods
- **Root Access Requirements**: Investigation of root access requirements for DNS operations
- **System-Level Alternatives**: Exploration of alternative DNS configuration methods
- **User Manual Configuration**: Documentation of manual permission setup requirements
