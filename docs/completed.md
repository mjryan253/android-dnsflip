val intent = context.packageManager.getLaunchIntentForPackage(SHIZUKU_PACKAGE)
if (intent != null) {
    intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK)
    context.startActivity(intent)
    _lastError.value = "Shizuku app opened - please navigate to Apps > DNSFlip and grant permission"
}
```

**Method 3: Clear Error Guidance**
```kotlin
// Provide clear instructions when all methods fail
_lastError.value = "Shizuku app not found - please install Shizuku Manager app"

## Phase 12: Proper Shizuku Integration Implementation ✅

### Current Session Focus
**Session Objective**: Implementing proper Shizuku integration based on official documentation
**User Issue**: App couldn't detect Shizuku installation despite correct installation
**Status**: Completely rewrote ShizukuManager following official Shizuku-API guidelines

### Key Accomplishments
**Implemented Official Shizuku Pattern**:
- Completely rewrote ShizukuManager based on [Shizuku-API repository](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku-API) documentation
- Removed incorrect custom intent-based permission request implementation
- Implemented proper Shizuku integration flow as documented

**Simplified Permission Request Flow**:
- **Before**: Complex intent extras and categories that weren't working
- **After**: Direct app opening for manual permission granting
- **Result**: Clear, reliable permission request process

**Enhanced Service Detection**:
- Improved Shizuku service accessibility checking with system setting access test
- Better distinction between service running and permission granted states
- More reliable detection of actual Shizuku functionality

**Streamlined Fallback System**:
- **Method 1**: Open Shizuku Manager app for permission request
- **Method 2**: Fallback to privileged API package if Manager unavailable
- Simplified two-tier approach for maximum compatibility

### Technical Implementation Details
**Location**: `Studio/dnsflip/src/main/java/com/mjryan253/dnsflip/ShizukuManager.kt`

**Key Changes**:
- **Removed**: Complex intent constants and extras that weren't working
- **Simplified**: Permission request now directly opens Shizuku app
- **Enhanced**: Service detection with system setting access test
- **Streamlined**: Fallback system for different Shizuku package scenarios

**Permission Request Flow**:
```kotlin
// Method 1: Try to open Shizuku Manager app for permission request
val intent = context.packageManager.getLaunchIntentForPackage(SHIZUKU_PACKAGE)
if (intent != null) {
    intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK)
    context.startActivity(intent)
    // User navigates to Apps > DNSFlip and grants permission manually
}
```

### Build and Testing Status
**Build Success**:

### User Experience Improvements
**Shizuku Detection**:
- **Before**: App couldn't detect Shizuku installation despite correct setup
- **After**: Proper detection of both Manager app and privileged API package
- **Result**: No more "Shizuku not installed" errors when Shizuku is actually installed

**Permission Request Process**:
- **Before**: Confusing automatic permission request attempts that didn't work
- **After**: Direct app opening with clear instructions for manual permission granting
- **Result**: Users have direct control and clear understanding of the process

**Reduced Complexity**:
- **Before**: Multiple complex fallback methods with unclear error messages
