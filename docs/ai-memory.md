# AI Memory - DNSFlip Project

## Project Overview
DNSFlip is an Android application that allows users to switch between system DNS and custom DNS servers without requiring root access. The app uses Shizuku for system permission management and provides a user-friendly interface for DNS configuration.

## Current Status: Phase 21 - Code Cleanup and Redundancy Removal Complete

### What Was Accomplished in Phase 21
- **Code Redundancy Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of entire codebase to identify redundancies and non-essential code
- **UI Component Consolidation**: Removed duplicate LightSwitch implementation, keeping only LargeLightSwitch
- **DNSManager Streamlining**: Removed redundant methods and consolidated error handling while maintaining functionality
- **ShizukuManager Simplification**: Eliminated overlapping permission checking methods and simplified state management
- **MainActivity Optimization**: Removed redundant state variables and UI elements, unified permission state management
- **Theme System Cleanup**: Removed unused colors (OLEDBlackSecondary, TextDisabled) to simplify color palette
- **Test File Cleanup**: Removed generic example test files that weren't specific to app functionality
- **Code Quality Improvement**: Reduced code complexity while maintaining all core functionality

### Previous Phase 20 Discovery
- **Critical Shizuku Limitation**: Shizuku cannot grant `WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` permission - this is a fundamental system restriction
- **Permission Testing Results**: Even with manual Shizuku access granted, DNS operations still fail with SecurityException
- **Alternative Approaches Required**: Need to research and implement alternative methods for DNS configuration
- **User Manual Configuration**: Users must use ADB or root access to grant the required permission

### Current Implementation Status (Post-Cleanup)
- **DNSManager.kt**: Streamlined with consolidated methods, removed redundant functions while maintaining detailed error reporting
- **ShizukuManager.kt**: Simplified with unified permission checking and reduced method complexity
- **MainActivity.kt**: Optimized with unified state management using ShizukuManager as single source of truth
- **LightSwitch.kt**: Consolidated to single LargeLightSwitch component with simplified styling
- **Theme System**: Cleaned up with unused colors removed, maintaining OLED-optimized dark theme
- **Error Handling**: Maintained comprehensive error reporting with simplified implementation
- **Code Quality**: Reduced complexity while preserving all core functionality

### Technical Details (Post-Cleanup)
- **Streamlined Error Reporting**: Maintained `DnsOperationResult` class with consolidated error handling
- **Simplified Permission Management**: Unified permission checking through ShizukuManager as single source of truth
- **Consolidated UI Components**: Single LargeLightSwitch component with simplified styling and animations
- **Optimized State Management**: Removed redundant state variables, using ShizukuManager state directly
- **Clean Theme System**: Removed unused colors while maintaining OLED-optimized dark theme
- **Reduced Code Complexity**: Eliminated duplicate methods and redundant functionality
- **Maintained Functionality**: All core DNS switching and error handling capabilities preserved

### What's Now Fully Functional (Post-Cleanup)
1. **Streamlined Error Reporting**: Maintained detailed error messages with simplified implementation
2. **Unified Permission Management**: Single source of truth for permission state through ShizukuManager
3. **Consolidated UI Components**: Single, optimized light switch component with clean styling
4. **Simplified State Management**: Reduced complexity while maintaining all functionality

## Recent Chat Session Updates (Current Session)

### Phase 20: Critical Shizuku Limitation Discovery
- **Problem Identified**: Shizuku cannot grant `WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` permission - this is a fundamental system restriction
- **Root Cause**: `WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` is a system-level permission that requires special handling beyond Shizuku's capabilities
- **Evidence**: Even with manual Shizuku access granted, DNS operations still fail with SecurityException
- **Impact**: Current Shizuku-based approach is fundamentally flawed and cannot work

### Testing Process Documentation
- **Manual Permission Testing**: User manually granted Shizuku access to DNSFlip
- **Error Pattern Analysis**: Consistent SecurityException for WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS across all attempts
- **Log Analysis**: Comprehensive logcat monitoring revealed the fundamental limitation
- **User Feedback**: "Still not asking for permissions, still not granting them" - confirmed Shizuku limitation

### Deployment Automation
- **Cross-Platform Scripts**: Created PowerShell (.ps1), batch (.bat), and shell (.sh) scripts for rapid deployment
- **Automated Workflow**: Scripts handle build, install, launch, and logcat monitoring automatically
- **Development Efficiency**: Significantly reduces time for testing iterations and debugging
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README created for deployment script usage and troubleshooting

### Enhanced Error Handling
- **Specific Permission Detection**: App now properly identifies when specific permissions are missing
- **User Action Guidance**: Clear instructions for resolving permission issues
- **Troubleshooting Interface**: Enhanced UI with better permission guidance and troubleshooting options
