# Next Steps - DNSFlip Project

## Current Status: Phase 22 Complete - Architectural Pivot to VpnService

The core architecture of the application has been successfully refactored to use Android's `VpnService` API. This resolves the fundamental roadblock of being unable to acquire the `WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` permission. The application is now functional on standard, non-rooted devices without requiring `adb`.

## Immediate Next Steps Required

### 1. Thorough End-to-End Testing
- **Manual Testing**: Install the APK on a physical device and test the entire user flow.
  - Test toggling the DNS on and off.
  - Test with various valid and invalid DNS server hostnames.
  - Test the VPN permission request flow (granting and denying).
  - Test behavior after device reboot.
- **Automated Testing**:
  - Write new unit tests for `VpnManager.kt`.
  - Write new instrumented tests for the `DnsVpnService` and `MainActivity` UI flow.

### 2. UI/UX Polish
- **Connection Status**: Add more detailed status indicators for "Connecting...", "Connected", and "Failed" states.
- **Error Handling**: Improve the display of errors if the VPN fails to connect for any reason (e.g., invalid hostname, system issue).
- **Persistence**: Ensure the VPN state is correctly restored or handled after the app is closed or the device reboots.

### 3. Release Preparation
- **Build Release APK**: Generate a signed, release-ready APK.
- **Update Release Notes**: Create clear release notes for the new version, explaining the significant architectural change and its benefits.
- **Publish**: Prepare for publishing to app stores or other distribution platforms.
